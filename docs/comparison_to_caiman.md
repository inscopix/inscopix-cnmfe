# Comparison of Inscopix-CNMFe and CaImAn CNMF-E
This section provides an in-depth comparison of Inscopix-CNMFe and CaImAn CNMF-E.
Key differences in the algorithm parameters, processing modes, and output formats are first highlighted.
We then present our approach for comparing the two implementations and present the results of such comparison
on various datasets.
We evaluated processing time and consistency between the outputs obtained using the two algorithms, as well as 
how processing time is affected by the input dimensions.

### Processing Modes
Three processing modes are available to run CNMFe: all in memory, sequential patches, parallel patches. 
The chosen processing mode determines the amount of computing resources that will be used by the algorithm and how work will be divided over such resources. 
In CaImAn CNMF-E, the processing mode is inferred based on user-specified parameters including the patch size (`rf`) and the view associated with the IPython Parallel computing cluster (`dview`). 
In Incopix-CNMFe, the processing mode and associated parallelism is explicitly specified by the user using the parameters ````
The processing modes as implemented in Incopix-CNMFe are described and described in the table below.

| Processing Mode  | Description |
|:----------|:-------------|
| All in memory | The entire field of view is loaded into memory and processed at once. |
| Sequential patches | The field of view is first split into spatially distinct areas (referred to as patches) that can partially overlap. Each patch is then processed one at a time using the specified number of threads where parallelization is possible. |
| Parallel patches | The field of view is first split into spatially distinct areas (referred to as patches) that can partially overlap. Patches are then processed in parallel using a single thread for each. The total number of threads allocated to CNMFe sets an upper limit on the number of patches that can be processed simultaneously. |

The boundaries of individual patches are determined using a different approach in each implementation.
In Inscopix-CNMFe, the dimensions of individual patches are fixed while the amount of overlap is allowed to vary to account for uneven movie dimensions. 
By contrast, in CaImAn CNMF-E the dimensions of individual patches are specified but can vary depending on the dimensions of the field of view.

### Output Units
The CNMFe algorithm outputs the spatial footprints and temporal activity of all cells identified during processing. 
An important distinction between Inscopix-CNMFe and CaImAn CNMF-E is that the temporal traces obtained using CaImAn CNMF-E 
are deconvolved using an autoregressive model while the default traces obtained from Inscopix-CNMFe are referred to as the raw traces, 
i.e. the traces prior to such deconvolution. The `deconvolve` parameter controls the type of traces produced by Inscopix-CNMFe (0: raw traces, 1: deconvolved traces).
The temporal traces are also scaled differently between the two implementations.
CaImAn CNMF-E traces are in terms of `dF` units whereas Inscopix-CNMFe allows the user to choose between `dF` and `dF over noise`
as described below.

| Output Units | Description |
|:----------|:-------------|
| dF | The temporal traces are on the same scale of pixel intensity as the original movie. dF is calculated as the average fluorescence activity of all pixels in a cell, scaled so that each spatial footprint has a magnitude of 1. |
| dF over noise | The temporal traces are divided by their respective estimated noise level. This can be interpreted similarly to a z-score, with the added benefit that the noise is a more robust measure of the variance in a temporal trace compared to the standard deviation. |

## Methods
In this section we present the approach we developed for comparing the footprints and temporal dynamics of neurons
identified using Inscopix-CNMFe to those obtained using CaImAn CNMF-E.
We refer to the footprints and corresponding temporal traces together as a cell set.
We also provide a summary of the hardware and software used to process the data, including the analysis parameters used for each dataset.

### Cell Set Comparison
In order to compare the outputs from Inscopix-CNMFe to those obtained from CaImAn, we first defined a metric to quantify the similarity between two cell sets.
The concept is best explained by first comparing one cell to another. 
A cell is defined by its spatial footprint (2D matrix) and its temporal activity (1D vector). 
Accordingly, two cells can be compared by measuring the similarity between their spatial footprints and the similarity between their temporal traces. 
We evaluated spatial similarity by computing the normalized cross-correlation of the footprints, and the temporal similarity by computing the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient of the traces. 
We then combined these two metrics into a single similarity measurement by averaging them, giving equal weight to the spatial and temporal components. 
Under this approach, we consider two cells to be the same if their spatiotemporal similarity is above some threshold, referring to such an event as a match. 
Below is an example where we compared the spatiotemporal profiles of a cell identified using Inscopix-CNMFe (first row) to a cell identified using CaImAn (second row).

![Single Cell Comparison](../img/single_cell_comparison.png?raw=true "Single Cell Comparison")

![Spatiotemporal Similarity Formula](../img/spatiotemporal_similarity_formula.png?raw=true "Spatiotemporal Similarity Formula")

To adapt the spatiotemporal correlation metric to entire cell sets, we calculated the pairwise spatial similarity and the pairwise temporal similarity between all cells from the two cell sets. 
From these matrices, we identified for each cell in the first cell set the cell from the second cell set with which it had the maximum spatial correlation. 
We then employed a greedy approach to compare and match cells starting from the pair with the highest spatial correlation. 
We computed the spatiotemporal correlation for each such pair of cells, i.e. one cell from CaImAn and the cell from Inscopix-CNMFe with which it had the maximum spatial correlation.
We called two cells a match (i.e. considered to be the same) if their spatiotemporal correlation was above a given threshold.

Rather than arbitrarily choosing a matching threshold, we varied the threshold from 0 to 1 and computed the proportion of cells matched at each value. 
This process generates a curve that shows the effect of varying the matching threshold on the number of cells that were matched as shown below. 
For near-identical cell sets, we would expect that even when using strict (high) threshold values the majority of cells would be matched. 
To evaluate the overall similarity of the two cell sets across all possible thresholds, we computed the area under the curve by integrating it using the trapezoidal composite rule, 
a concept analogous to the measurement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

### Processing Time Comparison
We compared the processing time of Inscopix-CNMFe and CaImAn CNMF-E on movies of different dimensions and durations.
We first measured processing time for a dataset consisting of 1000 frames of dimensions 128x128 pixels recorded in the striatum.
We then spatially expanded the data to measure the impact of the movie dimensions on processing time. 
Similarly, we expanded the movie temporally by concatenating copies of the same movie to measure the impact of the number of frames on processing time while keeping cell density constant. 
This provided us with a comprehensive set of movies that we used to compare the processing time of the two CNMFe implementations.

## Notes on Matching the Outputs from Inscopix-CNMFe and CaImAn CNMF-E
In order for Inscopix-CNMFe and CaImAn CNMF-E to produce comparable results, all analysis parameters must be matched as per the parameter mapping table above. 
The parameters not listed in that table are automatically set to CaImAnâ€™s default values. 
CaImAn's default processing mode is parallel patch mode, with the patch size set through the `rf` parameter. 
The all-in-memory mode can be used by setting `rf` equal to `None`. 
The sequential patch mode is used when `rf` is set to a positive value by setting the `dview` parameter of the CNMF object to `None` upon instantiation. 
In Inscopix-CNMFe, the processing mode can be specified explicitly via the input parameter `processing_mode`.
The output units in Inscopix-CNMFe should be set to `dF` to match CaImAnâ€™s units.
