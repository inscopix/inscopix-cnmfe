# Comparison of Inscopix-CNMFe and CaImAn
This section provides guidance and tips on how to fine-tune the CNMFe input parameters
based on the results obtained by the algorithm. The default parameters may not be optimal for all datasets.
As such, it is important to understand how each parameter affects processing in order to
determine which ones to tweak to obtain the desired output.


## Input Parameters

### Parameter Mapping
The table below provides a mapping from the parameters used in Inscopix-CNMFe to the corresponding parameters in CaImAn. 
Note that some parameters are unique to Inscopix-CNMFe and relate to features not available in open-source implementations.
This includes the trace output units and the explicit processing modes.
